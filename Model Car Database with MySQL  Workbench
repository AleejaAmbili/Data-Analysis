# 🚗 Model Car Database Analysis (MySQL Workbench)

## Overview
This project analyzes an automobile model inventory database using SQL to uncover sales trends, overstocked items, and data-driven recommendations for inventory optimization.

## Key Features
- Imported and explored the relational model car database in MySQL Workbench.
- Executed SQL queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`.
- Summarized product performance by product line and sales.
- Identified overstocked models and recommended inventory reduction strategies.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL

## Example Insights
- Classic Cars have the highest inventory but slower turnover.
- Motorcycles generate the most revenue per model.
- Some models have >1.5 inventory-to-sales ratio — ideal candidates for clearance.

## Recommendations
- Reduce reorder frequency for slow sellers.
- Offer promotions to clear overstocked items.
- Increase availability of top-performing models.

## Files
- `SQL_Scripts/`: Contains all query files.
- `Results/`: Contains insights and screenshots.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
